20181022:  All of this is a work in progress.  Compiling a bunch of things that don't work from multiple sources into something that works.
I'm not trying to steal anyone's thunder here.  A lot/most/all of this stuff is cut and paste from other places and I'll get around to giving credit.
For now, I'm just combining a bunch of stuff from the following authors: sabas1080, grieve, selectnone, qwindelzorf, and an adafruit tutorial.
