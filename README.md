# pipboy2600
Ah yes, the pipboy2600 project.  I didn't get around to uploading all my fixes but I hope to do so this summer now that I'm setting things up again.  Digging out my milkcrate (server) from storage and opening the barrel of monkeys that is my archives of projects..projects of projects...projects of projected projects.....all in all, about 300 gigs of projects that have never had their code graced by the presence of a computer that wasn't hacked together from parts bought at a yard sale for $20.
